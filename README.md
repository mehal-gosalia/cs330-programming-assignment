# cs330-programming-assignment
## Description:
  This project involves simulating a security device installation system. My project is divided into two parts, named "part1" and "part2".
  
  1. The first file which is "part1.py" includes an empty array and a second array including my security code using last 5 digits of my Student ID i.e '84633'.
  2. After that I have included a while loop for the code to run as a finite loop. Next I have included "if else' comments. The first if-else command checks whether the code entered is a digit or not. The second if-else command checks if the first 5 elements match the requried code and outputs according to the digits entered whether my device is locked or not.
  
**IMPORTANT** : 
Part 2 of my code includes my test file as well. I defined the function "main" where I randomly generate numbers under a while loop and I have created a count which helps us to check the end time and the number of iterations.


## Setting up:

Cloning the repository-
```
$ git clone https:/mehal-gosalia/cs330-programming-assignment.git
```
The files are created through python 3-
```
$ python3 -m coverage run -m unittest
```
Executable:
For first file:
```
$ ./part1.py
```
For second file:
```
$ ./part2.py
```

I have also created a raw design of the logic i used behind my codes to help me better in understanding-
