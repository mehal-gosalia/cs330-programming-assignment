# cs330-programming-assignment
## Description:
  This project involves simulating a security device installation system. My project is divided into two parts, named "part1" and "part2".
  
  1. The first file which is "part1.py" includes an empty array and a second array including my security code using last 5 digits of my Student ID i.e '84633'.
  2. After that I have included a while loop for the code to run as a finite loop. Next I have included "if else' comments. The first if-else command checks whether the code entered is a digit or not. The second if-else command checks if the first 5 elements match the requried code and outputs according to the digits entered whether my device is locked or not.
